## Machine Test Documentation

### Overview

This project is part of a machine test assignment designed to evaluate my knowledge of **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript**. I was tasked with building a graduate web application landing page that implements smooth animations using **Framer Motion**. The project required adhering to a strict timeline while learning new tools and technologies.

The deliverables included:
1. **Source Code**: The complete source code hosted on a Git repository (GitHub).
2. **README File**: This README file containing setup, usage, and test instructions.
3. **Documentation**: Clear and detailed documentation of the machine test and the steps taken to complete it.
4. **Hosted Project**: The project hosted on a free platform (Vercel).

### Challenges Faced

- As I was not previously familiar with Next.js, this project presented an excellent opportunity to learn it in a short span of time.
- Understanding and implementing smooth animations using **Framer Motion** was another challenge that I was able to overcome during this project.
- Tailwind CSS allowed for rapid styling, but there was a learning curve in ensuring the UI remained consistent across all screen sizes.

### Approach

1. **Learning Next.js**: Focused on understanding the basics of server-side rendering and static site generation.
2. **Framer Motion**: Implemented animations for smooth scrolling and user interactions.
3. **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling and ensuring responsiveness.
4. **Version Control**: Hosted the project on GitHub for version control and easy collaboration.

### Documentation

- A detailed explanation of my learning journey, the problems I solved, and the features I implemented has been included.
- Setup and usage instructions were documented for seamless project deployment.

### Hosted Link
